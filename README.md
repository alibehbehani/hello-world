About me


My name is Ali Behbehani, a 29 year old Sales Professional, born and raised in London living in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro). With over 5 years experience generating revenue and profit for EM360 Tech (em360tech.com), a tech hub for IT & Business executives. I have a great track record in generating revenue with over 150 k in one year winning numerous accounts with small mid and larger enterprises. I am a seasoned sales professional who is able to overcome challenges and bring in new ways and ideas in order to progress and deliver. 

I have been studying Blockchain, Bitcoin and other Altcoins over the last year buying/selling crypto coins. My belief is that the world is still at its infancy stage adopting blockchain but with larger scale adoption,investment and more use-cases crypto will sky-rocket with much more stability.      

 

Hope you will give me the opportunity to prove what I can do for you and may we continue a working relationship for many years to come.

I look forward to your response.
Ali Behbehani
